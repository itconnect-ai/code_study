## Constitution (MUST READ)

**IMPORTANT**: Before any implementation task, read the project constitution for development rules.

Constitution locations (check in order):

1. `my_constitution.md` (project root)
2. `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

Key requirements from Constitution:

- **TDD Required**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle for all implementations
- **Task Report Required**: After EACH task completion, create `docs/task-reports/TASK-{NNN}-{title}.md`
- **Commit Convention**: `{type}: {subject} - {TDD phase} ({task-id})`
